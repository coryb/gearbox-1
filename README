Gearbox Architecture
--------------------

There are four major components to a service built with gearbox:

   * gearman
   * mod_gearbox
   * gearbox workers and delay daemon
   * your workers

[gearman](http://gearman.org/) is used by gearbox as a job server.  All workers
are gearman clients: they connect to gearman to get jobs to work on and to
submit child jobs.  Although gearman is currently the only implementation for
jobs, gearbox is abstracts all gearman interaction into a single class
(gearbox/job/GearmanJobImpl.cc), so it should be straightforward to add other
backends.  In fact, there's been a fair amount of discussion around adding an
AMQP implemenetation.

mod_gearbox is an apache module that ships with gearbox.  It will take HTTP
requests and marshal them into jobs.  By default, GETs are syncronous and hold
the HTTP connection open until the job completes and then return the job
response back to the user.  PUTs, POSTs, and DELETEs are done asyncronously, so
mod_gearbox returns a status object back to the user which the user can poll
to track the status of an operation.  mod_gearbox is not strictly required,
but a primary usecase of gearbox is building REST web services.

Gearbox workers are primarily used to generate status objects that track the
state of a job.  These workers are also used to help implement features like
delayed jobs, cancellations and agents.  The gearbox delay daemon manages jobs
which are scheduled to run in the future.
